Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting elements into their correct positions within a sorted subarray.
It's like sorting playing cards in our hands, where we pick a new card and place it in the right position.
We compare each element with the elements before it, shifting them if necessary to make space for the new element.
This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.
